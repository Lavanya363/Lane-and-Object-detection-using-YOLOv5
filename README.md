           **Real Time Lane and Object Detection using YOLOv5**
           ðŸ“ŒProject Overview:
           This project aims to build a real-time lane and object detection system using the YOLOv5 model.
           It combines computer vision techniques and deep learning to identify road lanes and detect 
           surrounding objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs from live video streams. 
           The YOLOv5 model ensures high-speed, accurate object detection, while classical image processing 
           methods handle lane detection. This system is designed to support autonomous driving and driver
           assistance technologies. The final output overlays detected lanes and objects on video frames for real-time visualization.
           
           âœ¨ Key Features:
           ðŸš˜ Real-Time Lane Detection: Identifies and tracks lane boundaries from live video feeds using OpenCV and computer vision techniques.
           ðŸŽ¯ Object Detection with YOLOv5: Accurately detects and classifies objects like vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs in real time
           ðŸ§  Combined Detection Pipeline: Seamlessly integrates lane and object detection into one efficient system for improved situational awareness.
           ðŸ“¹ Live Video Processing: Processes webcam or dashcam footage with minimal latency, ensuring real-time performance.
           ðŸ“Š Visual Overlays: Displays detected lanes and bounding boxes for objects directly on video frames for intuitive visualization.
